# About
Simple demonstration of project structure in C# with .NET

This example demonstrates a layered backend structure using `models`, `controllers` and `services`.

Here we use `delegates` that help with `SRP` (Single Responsibility Principle).

- `Namespaces` help organize code by layer.
- `Delegates` allow us to inject responsibilities.
- `Controllers` orchestrate, while `services` implement logic.
